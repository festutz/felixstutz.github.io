# Research Prototypes and Frameworks

I contribute to the shell script parallelization framework 
<strong>[PaSh](https://binpa.sh)</strong> [[*code*]](https://github.com/binpash/pash).
Mainly, <nobr>I designed</nobr>, implemented and integrated an 
<strong> annotation library for command invocations</strong> [[*code*]](https://github.com/binpash/annotations)
that provides means to specify command invocation behaviours in the form of annotations.
For PaSh, it provides parallelizability and input-output information.
Input-output information is required for the translation between actual shell scripts and our internal model for transformations.
For parallelization, the information is crucial for correctness and, best, as permissive as possible.


When working on projects with a theoretical focus, we usually implement a prototype to play around and evaluate our ideas.
They are publicly available.

  AMGC: A tool to verify asynchronous multiparty session types with generalised choice
  </strong>
  \\
  [[*code*]](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/fstutz/async-mpst-gen-choice)
  (for CONCUR21)
- <strong>
  Lemma9: A tool to infer and check inductive invariants of cryptographic protocols
  </strong>
  \\
  [[*code*]](https://github.com/festutz/lemma9)
  (for CONCUR20)

As an undergraduate assistant, I helped with the initial version of 
<strong>[PROSA](https://prosa.mpi-sws.org/)</strong>, 
which is a Coq framework of and for definitions and proofs for real-time schedulability analysis.
