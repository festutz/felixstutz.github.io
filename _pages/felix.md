# About

<span class="bluelinks">
Hey! I'm Felix, a PhD student at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), <nobr>co-advised</nobr> by [*Rupak Majumdar*](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/) and [*Damien Zufferey*](https://dzufferey.github.io/).

My main research area is formal methods for concurrent and distributed systems.
My current focus is analysis of message-passing programs.
These consist of a collection of processes which interact exclusively by exchanging messages asynchronously.
I try to understand how we can check that such programs behave as they should.
If you are curious about details, my [Research](/research) section is the place to go for publications and my [Software](/software) section gives an overview of software projects.

Earlier this year, I spent half a year with [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/) at [<nobr>MIT CSAIL</nobr>](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working on the shell script parallelization framework [PaSh](https://binpa.sh/).

Before my PhD studies, I got a Masters degree from [University of Saarland](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/).
During that time, <nobr>I did</nobr> a half-year research internship at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) with [Emanuele D'Osualdo](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/) and [Philippa Gardner](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pg/).

By the way, feel free to (asynchronously ðŸ˜‰) send me a message if something piques your interest, or you just want to say hi!
