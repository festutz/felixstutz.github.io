# About

<span class="bluelinks">
Hey! I'm Felix, a PhD student at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), <nobr>co-advised</nobr> by [*Rupak Majumdar*](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/) and [*Damien Zufferey*](https://dzufferey.github.io/).

In general, I am broadly interested in concurrency and formal methods for distributed computing.
For my research, I mostly consider message-passing programs.
These consist of different <nobr>sub-programs</nobr> which do not share common state but solely communicate via possibly delayed messages -- which is also called asynchronous communication.
I try to understand how we can check that such programs behave as they should.
For one approach, we start with a global description of the program and automatically generate the sub-programs.
If this generation is successful, we know that the sub-programs are safe to use.

Earlier this year, I spent half a year with [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/) at [<nobr>MIT CSAIL</nobr>](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working on the shell script parallelization framework [PaSh](https://binpa.sh/).

Before my PhD studies, I got a Masters degree from [University of Saarland](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/).
During that time, <nobr>I did</nobr> a half-year research internship at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) with [Emanuele D'Osualdo](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/) and [Philippa Gardner](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pg/).

By the way, if something is interesting to you or you would like to discuss something, just (asynchronously) send me a message!
