# About

<span class="bluelinks">
Hey! I'm Felix, a research (and development) specialist in the [Security and Trust of Software Systems (SaToSS) group](https://satoss.uni.lu/) led by [Sjouke Mauw](https://satoss.uni.lu/members/sjouke/) at the [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/en/).
My main research area is formal methods for concurrent and distributed systems as well as security protocols.
If you are curious about details, my [Research](/research) section is the place to go for publications and my [Software](/software) section gives an overview of software projects.
</span>

Prior, I was a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), <nobr>co-advised</nobr> by [Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/) and [Damien Zufferey](https://dzufferey.github.io/).
Back then, my main research focus has been the analysis of message-passing programs.
These consist of a collection of processes which interact exclusively by exchanging messages asynchronously.
We devised algorithms to check that such programs behave as they should.
In 2022, I spent half a year with [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/) at [<nobr>MIT CSAIL</nobr>](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working on the shell script parallelization framework [PaSh](https://binpa.sh/).

Even earlier, I got a Masters degree from [University of Saarland](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/).
During that time, <nobr>I did</nobr> a half-year research internship at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) with [Emanuele D'Osualdo](https://www.emanueledosualdo.com/) and [Philippa Gardner](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pg/).

By the way, feel free to (asynchronously ðŸ˜‰) send me a message if something piques your interest, or you just want to say hi!
