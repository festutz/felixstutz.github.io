In my free time, I also enjoy building physical things (rather than only software).

My latest project is a <strong>campervan conversion</strong>.\\
Some time ago, my fianc√© and I bought an empty van and are building our own personal camping vehicle.
It is a pretty big project. 
One can think of it as a mini version of a house with similar but also different challenges: installing windows, insulation, electricity with solar power, building furniture, etc.
It is very rewarding and a lot of fun to learn new crafting skills and get better at them.

When I get the chance, I'll post some details and photos here.
